Here’s a clear and concise `README.md` file for the GitHub Action you provided:

---

### 📦 Node.js CI Pipeline with GitHub Actions

This project includes a simple GitHub Actions workflow for running automated tests whenever code is pushed to the repository.

---

### 🔧 CI Workflow Overview

The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (or similar), and is triggered on every push.

#### **Workflow name:** `CI Pipeline`

#### **Trigger:**

* `on: [push]` – the workflow runs whenever you push code to any branch.

---

### ✅ What it Does

1. **Checks out the repository**
   Uses the `actions/checkout@v3` action to clone the repo.

2. **Sets up Node.js**
   Uses `actions/setup-node@v3` to install Node.js version `18`.

3. **Installs dependencies**
   Runs `npm install` to install your project’s packages.

4. **Runs your tests**
   Executes `npm test`, which runs your Jest test suite.

### 💡 Requirements

* Your project must have a valid `package.json`.
* The `test` script should be defined, e.g.:

  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
  ```
